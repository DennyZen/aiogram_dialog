Transitions
*****************************

Every time you need to render text use any of text widgets:

* :ref:`Types of transitions<types>` - Talking to user you will need to switch between different chat states.
* :ref:`Task stack<task_stack>` - To deal with multiple opened dialogs **aiogram_dialog** has such thing as dialog stack.
* :ref:`State switch<state_switch>` - Simplest thing you can do to change UI layout is to switch dialog state.
* :ref:`Starting a dialog<start_dialog>`
* :ref:`Closing a dialog<close_dialog>`
